# Instructions

Run `yarn start` and then open up the browser console. Click the Updated state or the Mount/Unmount button to see what methods they fire in the component lifecycle.

It is important to note that the Component Lifecycle and Component Lifecycle Methods are in fact different. The lifecycle is composed of 4 phases:

1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting
4. Error Handling

There are multiple lifecycle *methods* that make up each lifecycle.

NOTE: There are more component lifecycle methods than just the ones listed in the ComponentLifeCycle component, but those are the ones that you would most often use. I listed them in the order that they happen, common convention is to always have render at the bottom.

For more information about the specifics of the component lifecycle, or lifecycle methods visit the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
